## Running Examples
 
To run the tests against the REST Api, you need to start the server first. 
Therefore you can just Right-Click on the WasteTypeApplication.java and select Run As -> Java Application.

Then the Integration Tests can be started with the port 8081
The Service Tests can be run without the need of a server.

To access the Service you can go to e.g "http://localhost:8081/waste/v1/Plastic/10.21,15.22"
